# BASIC LANDING PAGE
This is the second project in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) Foundations section, and specifically at the end of the Flexbox section. 

## PROJECT CONTENT
A basic landing page containing some dummy text content, in its start.Later i will probably use this template for a brand i will create as a landing page. The Odin Project's creators asked to create this single-page landing page while providing with the proper images for the website's final design and font and colors they used to create it as cheatsheets. 

Here are the necessary starting image links:
* Link to website's [fina look](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png)
* Link to website's cheatsheet [styles](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/a38403e7d81cc8305af16ac48985cfbde87834d6/foundations/html_css/flexbox/project-landing-page/imgs/02.png)

## TOOLS
As this project is in the last lesson of the Flexbox section (not Grid yet) in Foundations, i will surely use vanilla HTML, CSS and the Flexbox Layout to get all elements in the right position and proper style. 

## CHALLENGES
Coming soon...
